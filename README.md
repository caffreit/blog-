This blog has two purposes, the first is to help secure a job by showcasing my portfolio of coding experience.

The second is to serve as a reference for me when I'm working on future projects.

The first project to be published will be a series on the Malahide Park Run. This is a set of roughly 80 thousand runs, each run has a finish time, name, age and several other attributes recorded. This rich dataset is ideal to improve my data science abilties.

Here's the link to the [first post](https://caffreit.github.io/ParkRunPart1/) of the Malahide ParkRun analysis.


Oh, and for the moment (next week or so), this blog is under construction and will look a bit rough around the edges! (>.<)
