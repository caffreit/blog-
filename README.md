## Welcome to my blog-
This blog has two purposes, the first is to help secure a job by showcasing my portfolio of coding experience. [See more](https://github.com/caffreit) of my academic work.

The second is to serve as a reference for me when I'm working on future projects.

My first project posted here will be a series on the Malahide Park Run. It has been running for several years; the dataset has roughly 80 thousand records. Each record corresponds to a run and associated with it are a number of variables: finish time, position, age and several others. This rich dataset is ideal to display and improve my data science skills.

### Oh, and for the moment (next week or so), this blog is under construction and will look a bit rough around the edges! (>.<)
